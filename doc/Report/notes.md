# General Design Principles:
- Directivity is measured relative to an isotropic sources (max power density)/Isotropic power density (pg 18) / loosely referred to as 'Gain'
- Efficiency: Power radiated / Power in
- Gain = efficiency * Directivity
- Radiation Pattern is the far-field 3d pattern in which power is radiated. Shows power density verses angle


# Matching Techniques
- 1/2 wave balun --> creates a 1:4 ratio
- Double stub matching circuit

## Yagi-Uda

- One Driven Element
- Gain is directly proportional to boom length
- Bandwidth decreases with an increase in gain
- Gain bandwidth is a function of ratio of reflector length relative to director lengths.
